# Our final project for DCI demonstrating different techniqiues 
 ### We focused mainly on IoT concept 
 ### A Lego Car accessed through the cloud based on Arduino MKR1000 board controlled  from react interface.



<br>
<br>
<br>

 #### Techologies used:

<br>

>  ## Backend
- Database 
- Api
- WebSocket's
- C ++ 
- Node.js
- Sensors

>  ## Frontend
- React.js
- WebSocketClient
- Tensor flow.js (Voice control)
- Chart.js

# Explanation

###  Once the board  is  on   start two ways communication between board and the server.
### **Sensors** collect and transimit data to  the server where Node broadcast it to the all connected user on frontside
###  From control panel in front  users can control one servo  and one DC motor.
###  Users can control it through the **voice**   as well
